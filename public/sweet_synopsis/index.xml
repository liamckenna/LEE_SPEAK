      <title>Haribo Goldbears</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest – this was never a matter of &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;, but a matter of &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haribo is effectively the Nintendo of gummy candy, and this is their Mario. I mean, they are LITERALLY the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haribo.com/en-us/about-us/history&#34;&gt;first gummy bears ever made&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;rsquo;s impressive that over a century later they&amp;rsquo;re still widely available. Kind of like how Mario was originally named Jumpman, Goldbears were originally named Dancing Bears. While Mario&amp;rsquo;s name change came only four years after his debut, it took 40 years for the dancing bears to become precious metals. This rebrand coincided with a bit of a visual makeover, and there&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly limited documentation of the original design online. Best I could find is this Facebook post with a bit of a German soyjak thing going on. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Haribo is effectively the Nintendo of gummy candy, and this is their Mario. I mean, they are LITERALLY the <a href="https://www.haribo.com/en-us/about-us/history">first gummy bears ever made</a>, so it&rsquo;s impressive that over a century later they&rsquo;re still widely available.

<p>Aside from the height reduction and slight recipe adjustments over the years, like substituting gum arabic for gelatin (hence the &ldquo;gum&rdquo; in gummy bear), Goldbears really haven&rsquo;t changed much at all. It ought to be respected for that timelessness, and I really should have started this series here.</p>

<p>Each bear has just over a gram of sugar (~14g per 13 pieces to be precise) which is unremarkable if not a little much considering how small they are. There are, of course, five flavors: red, green, orange, yellow, and clear.</p>

<p>Officially, these are raspberry, strawberry, orange, lemon, and pineapple respectively. I have been scowering the web looking for some legitimate popularity poll of these flavors because I feel like every person I&rsquo;ve asked shares a different opinion. Haribo should probably host one themselves because I&rsquo;d really like to know.</p>
<p>The order above was what I <em>thought</em> my personal ranking would be. Going through them individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red has a really nice tartness to it that, in combination with the sweet berry flavor, makes it stand out the most to me.</li>
<li>Green lacks such tartness but is also probably the sweetest and cleanest flavor of the bunch.
Between the two, I&rsquo;d say green is more enjoyable while chewing whereas red really hits its stride in its aftertaste.</li>
<li>Orange does a commendable job at replicating its intended taste but compared to the others is quite overpowering. Goldbears generally offer a more subtle flavor profile but orange unfortunately bucks that consistency.</li>
<li>Yellow was a surprisingly sweet lemon flavor that I enjoyed more than I was anticipating but left an ever-so-slightly bitter, artificial aftertaste.</li>
<li>Clear was similarly more pleasant than I remember, but I&rsquo;m still left questioning it&rsquo;s inclusion over more standard fruity flavors like grape, cherry, green apple or watermelon. It mostly feels like an opportunity cost because the pineapple flavor is only really distinguishable in the aftertaste.</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusive ranking for me would likely go as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Red (Raspberry)</li>
<li>Green (Strawberry)</li>
<li>Yellow (Lemon)</li>
<li>Clear (Pineapple)</li>
<li>Orange</li>
</ol>

<p>The gummies themselves are extremely consistent in presentation and manufacturing. However, the representation of each flavor is&hellip; a mixed bag. Sorry. I don&rsquo;t know how to deliver a good pun over text without it reading straight out of 2010s Tumblr. Universally, Haribo gummies are slightly greasy. Nothing egregeous, but it&rsquo;s not something they should be proud of. One piece of advice I&rsquo;ll give is to really chew into these before swallowing. I ended up getting a lot better appreciation for their flavors this way.</p>
<p>All that said, it&rsquo;s hard to hate on Goldbears. They&rsquo;ve stuck around this long for good reason, and without them, there is no Sweet Synopsis.</p>

<p>This is aging quite well. Not to mention I&rsquo;ll be in Japan for the rest of the year, so I can&rsquo;t wait to see all the standard American candy over there. I even had a scrapped Dubai Chocolate review that cost me $20. Good times!</p>

<p>Arabic translator says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>79 grams of sugar in the whole bitch.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot! I can&rsquo;t give exact per-ribbon counts cause I&rsquo;m not about to count how many there are in the package but it&rsquo;s safe to say that sugar counts are high.</p>



<img

<p>I need a better camera setup but it&rsquo;s fine for now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some good Saure Drachenzungen! Despite how it may look the sugar coating doesn&rsquo;t actually provide any immediate sweetness or flavor for that matter, so the first two or so seconds is kind of nothing. As soon as I chewed into it though, that saure hit me like a truck. Like holy shit these are STRONG.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good strong though. Damn good! It overpowers the sweeter, subtler raspberry flavor, but not to a point where that sweetness is missed. It&rsquo;s good, and it lingers for quite a while after the ribbon&rsquo;s gone.</p>



<img

<p>There&rsquo;s honestly a lot in the package, and I found the pace at which I ate them to be relatively slow. I almost needed time for the tartness to cool down between ribbons. That&rsquo;s a good thing though &ndash; slower means more time to appreciate the candy. I&rsquo;ll never complain about candy that earns its runtime, if you will.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 4½ bangins</h2>
<h2> ★★★★⯪</h2>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Strong flavor that remains after finished.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Lots to go around.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Lasted a long time without getting overwhelming or heavy.
</li>
<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Slightly unbalanced flavor profile, could use a bit more sweetness.
</li>
<h2> Recommendation: ☺🔥︎</h2>
<p>Germans eatin gooooood with this.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to clear up some things before continuing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scores are out of 5 bangins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please recommend more candy in the commments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of chocolate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I specialize in gummy candy, but I&amp;rsquo;m open to covering chocolate in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final scores start at 2½ bangins and go from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re based foremost on how I feel, then I try to accurately map their qualities to the score
I have in my head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Sweet Tarts (stylized SweeTARTS, for some reason) is everywhere, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty
sure the same goes for Fruity Splitz, their main gummy line. You&amp;rsquo;re gonna hear this sentiment a lot
from me, but I like some of the Sweet Tarts products &amp;ndash; what the fuck do they know about gummies?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Not much.</p>
<p>Though, I will give them props for the size of this package. Less gigantic bags, the better.
More candy brands need to expand their products to smaller offerings &ndash; specifically gummy brands. The
checkout counter is dominated by candy bars and gum, but I think there&rsquo;s a market for small package gummies.</p>
<p>Cudos for that, Sweet Tarts.</p>

<p>30 pieces, 270 calories, 42g of sugar. 1.5g of sugar per gummy, which is&hellip; fine I guess. You&rsquo;re not
gonna see anything compare to the low sugar density of <a href="https://leespeak.me/sweet_synopsis/mario_gummies/">foreign candy</a>.</p>

<p>The flavors are as standard as they come, which is no surprise since they just contextualized the flavors of

<p>Cherry, Apple, Lemon, Orange, and Grape are all here, but out of the 30 gummies, I didn&rsquo;t get a single blue peach.
It&rsquo;s disappointing since it&rsquo;s the only interesting flavor here, at least going off name.</p>

<p>Can you see the grease? I can certainly feel it. This is what ultimately ruins this gummy for me: they&rsquo;re so damn greasy.
Like, it&rsquo;s immediately on your fingers and you can&rsquo;t chew on them without feeling it.</p>
<p>Consistency is alright. The top and bottom halves give the same bite, one just has the appearance of transparency.
They&rsquo;re really the same feeling, though. Not too tough, slightly mushy, but the grease really just distracts from the bite.</p>
<p>The flavors are good; granted, none of them are new and all are just ripped from the original product. Taste is king, though,
so they earn considerable points here.</p>
<p>Lastly, as hinted at prior, the manufacturing really leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>It gets egregious when an entire flavor is missing, even if it&rsquo;s just one of six.</p>

<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  Strong assortment of six flavors.

<h2> Recommendation: ☹👎︎</h2>
<p>Just get regular Sweet Tarts and avoid the grease.</p>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think my first official Sweet Synopsis review would be on a $13 Japanese import I found at a smoke shop.
FYI, I don&amp;rsquo;t smoke but was picking up some for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to set the precedent that this is a foreign candy review show,
because it&amp;rsquo;s not. The vast majority of what I plan to review are items you will find at every CVS or gas station in the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think my first official Sweet Synopsis review would be on a $13 Japanese import I found at a smoke shop.
FYI, I don&rsquo;t smoke but was picking up some for a friend.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see the price tag until it got rung up and in the moment, all I wanted was to <em>not</em> look broke and lame. I panicked
and not only bought the gummies, but happily took the 2 for $30 deal on geek bars with money that wasn&rsquo;t mine. I also forgot to
look at the expiration date. Granted, it&rsquo;s not like they were selling year past expired candy. Surely.</p>

<p>Ok well it&rsquo;s not a year past expired. It&rsquo;s eight months and those four can make all the difference I hope. Astute readers will have
already noticed this.</p>

<p>As part of the formalities, each gummy has 0.3 grams of sugar. There are 19 gummies in the bag, which gives us an extremely
impressive 5.7 grams of sugar in the entire package. As more of these are released, you&rsquo;ll see just how incredible that stat is.
American nutrition facts don&rsquo;t give decimal values, so that is also appreciated here. 0.3g turns into &lt;1g which is just stupid
and uninformative.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the &ldquo;Shelf Life: 10 Months&rdquo; at the bottom. I&rsquo;m praying that I&rsquo;ll never have to review another piece of candy
that&rsquo;s a year and a half old.</p>
<p>Opening the bag delivered an intensely stiff scent of melon. It&rsquo;s to be expected but damn was it strong. If you see a flavored food
in Japan that&rsquo;s colored green, there&rsquo;s a 99% chance it&rsquo;s melon flavored.</p>

<p>These are no doubt all just reused renders of the characters but it&rsquo;s still very cute. I recognize quite a few of them, like the
Mario 3D World one right from the bottom left, and the mario party one to the right of that. I&rsquo;m gonna try the odd red out on the
far left.</p>

<p>This feels like a bad omen, but it&rsquo;s one I signed up for.</p>
<p>I mentioned the green was most definitely melon from the smell. As for the other flavor: I had probably subconsciously read this
on the English part of the packaging and forgot, but I correctly guessed it was cola. I can&rsquo;t read japanese. Astute readers will
have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Anyways, I won&rsquo;t be saying this ever again to be clear, but in the spirit of the episode&hellip; itadakimasu.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; a hard swallow. The inside is actually really good, which gives me the impression that if these
weren&rsquo;t crusted and 18 months old, I&rsquo;d be having a great time. I should reiterate how impressive it is that they&rsquo;re plenty sweet
and have a fifth of the sugar the next episode&rsquo;s subject has.</p>

<p>The melon flavor was alright. It&rsquo;s standard melon flavor, but I&rsquo;m just not super partial towards it.</p>
<p>I got a mushroom too, which makes me think how many other shapes are in here. On the packaging, they only advertise a Mario and
a Yoshi. Astute readers will have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Finishing that one off I realized that I really don&rsquo;t want to eat these anymore. The only reasonable thing to do, then, is to open
up all the remaining pieces to see which gummy shapes I get.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the boy. Just as decrepit as I remember :)</p>

<p>I think I hear someone faintly whispering something like &ldquo;Killlll meeeeeee.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m definitely not eating him if that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s
asking.</p>

<p>Just wanted to reiterate how FUCKING OLD THESE THINGS ARE.</p>
<p>Anyways, with all of them opened, I have the complete roundup.</p>

<p>I found one more! A koopa shell, or I guess it&rsquo;d be a green shell like how the mushroom is a red mushroom. Maybe the idea is that
green mario is supposed to be luigi, because shape of gummy has a red and green variant within the games.</p>
<p>As shitty as this lighting is, it actually better represents the color of the gummies. They&rsquo;re not nearly as dark in shade as the
other pictures would suggest.</p>
<p>I dunno. Maybe these would be edible if you cut off the crust shell.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 2 bangins</h2>
<h2> ★★☆☆☆</h2>
<p>Like all Sweet Synopsis reviews, we start with a base of 2½ bangins.</p>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Neat rare shapes.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Cute packaging renders.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Low amount of high quality sugar.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Good, standard cola flavoring.
</li>
<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    The age/crust.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    The price.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Melon flavoring is just not my favorite.
</li>
<h2> Recommendation: ☹👎︎</h2>
<p>Only if you&rsquo;re in japan. If you can find them cheap and relatively fresh, they&rsquo;re well worth it.</p>

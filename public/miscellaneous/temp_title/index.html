    <p>I think like any normal human there are moments where I find myself comparing the person I want to be with the person I currently am. I guess it&rsquo;s also normal to say that we all want things we, in absolute terms, cannot have. Sometimes, the role I romanticize playing is simply not that for which I am built.</p>
<p>I find that a little weird. To be clear, I mean that there are personality traits I wish I possessed, which I lack, and ones I champion, wishing I didn&rsquo;t. Not developmental traits like maturity and courage, mind you, I&rsquo;m talking about the practically immutable ones. The ones that show when your guard is down, the ones that have followed you for as long as you can remember, the ones that you&rsquo;re remembered by, good and bad.</p>
<p>Example: I am a deeply <em>unserious</em> person by default. My natural disposition, without any facades, is always scanning the room for a way to make others (and by extension, myself) laugh. I am compelled to this behavior and have always been. It is in my nature. Will some people find this annoying? Definitely! Sometimes, I am some people. But still, that&rsquo;s not a good reason for me to have deep-seeded desires of possessing the exact opposite disposition. It&rsquo;s like, sometimes I really want to hit the reroll button on all my baseline attributes. It&rsquo;s not out of hatred for who I am, but moreso curiosity for what I could have been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid, frivilous, and nonsensical thought exercise to imagine myself as a completely different person, and yet I partake anyways. Quite often, honestly, and I doubt that&rsquo;s good for me. But let&rsquo;s stop here at this fork in the road, because there are two directions I could take this thought: one of them is deeply serious and relates to myself and my psychology, and the other treads lightly into the abstract. How about we dip our toes into both and see which one we like more (but I&rsquo;m starting with the latter).</p>
<p>I think broadly, I want to reroll because I cannot. Because I am stuck in my skin and my head, I yearn to know how it feels on the other side. Not anywhere specific, just anywhere else. Doesn&rsquo;t that kind of suck though? That we really just&hellip; can&rsquo;t? I bet it&rsquo;s what drives expression and art and all that. I want to understand others in the same way I want to be understood, and I suppose that&rsquo;s the heart of connection. From that lens things don&rsquo;t seem like such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m gonna leave it there for now. Everything&rsquo;s a matter of perspective, and I stumbled my way into seeing the bright side of this feeling.</p>

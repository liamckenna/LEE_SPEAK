    <p>I had a dream that I lived in Japan. It&rsquo;s hard to remember, but I think I was really scared. There were a ton of people around me, which helped, but I remember being scared of them too. I had no reason to be; they were only ever kind towards me. They were impeccibly reiable, available, open, even when I (couldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t, refused to) reciprocate. At times I confided in them and immediately regretted it, out of habit. I had no reason to; they were only ever accepting of me. Maybe I had some silly notion that it was all temporary.</p>
<p>When I woke up, everything was back to normal. The dream was so overwhelming that I refused to let myself think about it. Turns out these sorts of things are really hard to forget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been close to 2 months now. That dream, the people within it, the memories they forged, and the emotions they evoke, all weigh heavy on my mind. Yet, I have refused to look any of it in the eye. I am still burrowing. Regardless of where or when, there&rsquo;s no escaping that who I am is a coward.</p>
<p>But I miss the people in my dream. I get reminded of them all the time. I want to see them again, even if only for a little. It may be hard; I imagine seeing their faces would remind me of all the baggage I&rsquo;ve ben shoving down, but that&rsquo;s not their fault. Hopefully, they&rsquo;d be happy to see me again too.</p>
<p>Right before waking up, I remember all of us going out to karaoke one last time. I think if it were real, that would have been one of the best nights of my life.</p>
<p>What a crazy, unforgettable dream.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s pretty rare that music truly resonates with me upon first listen. That&rsquo;s probably not uncommon, but what I don&rsquo;t think is normal is my tendency to effectively force myself to listen to music until I like it. Out of some unholy amalgamation of unwarranted pride, artistic longing, and search for personal definition, I want good taste in art. Whatever form it takes, I want to appreciate that which is held in high regard.</p>
<p>The targeted art form for such lunacy has shifted as I&rsquo;ve grown up. It began with video games, which I&rsquo;ll save as a subject for another time, then to movies. As a teen, I barely ever actually watched movies. I did watch, however, a lot of YouTube, and a lot of movie critics. During that time, the value of analysis and understanding, of what composed something worth discussing, was far greater to me than the subject of discussion. It may have been particularly egregious in this case because in retrospect I don&rsquo;t think I really cared about movies at all. I learned so much about them, how they work and what makes one special, entirely for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>At 20 years old, <a href="https://leespeak.me/music/idmthy_review/">music saved my life</a>. Habitually, artistic obsession followed suit, but this time for purer motivations. I wanted to understand music because, for the first time, I felt its impact. The same song and dance as before ensued. I began learning about music, which artists and albums received critical recognition, and why. The only difference this time was that I actually took the time to listen to the art about which I was learning. For some, this appreciation comes easy. For me, it absolutely does not, but I persist regardless. If I want to like an album, I will listen to it ten times before giving up on it. Usually by that point, it&rsquo;s grown on me plenty. Kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Despite how obtuse the act of forcefully developing good taste seems (and is), I believe it pays off. It&rsquo;s an ongoing effort, of course, but music has brought so much to my life. It&rsquo;s the result of exploring the medium and making an earnest effort to appreciate it. My ears are far more tuned now than a few years ago, but still:</p>

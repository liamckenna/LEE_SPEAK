Bordering on an open book, at times I think I’m too honest. This being publicly accessible is probably a testament to that. This is what I’ve always told myself and always believed.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’m underhanded. And cunning. Not in some sociopathic, badass manipulator way. Like, subtly, because I’m unconfident in doing things the proper way. I’d rather take a bunch of small invisible steps to get what I want than to just do the obvious single move.</p>
<p>In that way, I’m dishonest. I’m honest with my words and dishonest with my actions. I think people would hesitate to call it outright dishonesty but to me that’s what it is. My goals aren’t perverse or out of the ordinary but going about them in such obfuscated and obtuse ways makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong—probably because I am. I don’t want that to remain the case.</p>
<p>Being honest means being direct with yourself, and with others, in what you want. If you want something, go get it. Not in some sneaky, conniving way, but through forthright action. Don’t save face. Stop worrying about failure or embarrassment. Deal with that when it happens because it’s inevitable, no matter how hard you try and avoid it. If you want to say something then use your voice even when it feels impossible. There’s always a way, and most of the time the true solution is exponentially simpler than the roundabout way you concocted through your hours of mental pacing.</p>
<p>Just go for it, man.</p>

<p>2020 <br>
1 A.M. <br>
Walking along a hiking trail <br>
In a foreign state <br>
Surrounded by strangers <br>
It’s not a bad feeling.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it’s pure bliss, but it is exhilarating. <br>
And guttural. <br>
Nervewracking. <br>
Such a unique feeling to happen all but a few times in my life. It’s a feeling of uncertainty and hope that occupies my mental. I’m much more composed than I was five years ago, but it’s not often a new chapter in life begins. When it does, you feel it. This time, things read more like a footnote or a side story. Nonetheless, I am surrounded by strangers with whom I will soon enough, assuredly, grow close. It’s all hitting me at once now that I’m finally here. <br>
What an exciting feeling.</p>

<p>Haribo is effectively the Nintendo of gummy candy, and this is their Mario. I mean, they are LITERALLY the <a href="https://www.haribo.com/en-us/about-us/history">first gummy bears ever made</a>, so it&rsquo;s impressive that over a century later they&rsquo;re still widely available. Kind of like how Mario was originally named Jumpman, Goldbears were originally named Dancing Bears. While Mario&rsquo;s name change came only four years after his debut, it took 40 years for the dancing bears to become precious metals. This rebrand coincided with a bit of a visual makeover, and there&rsquo;s surprisingly limited documentation of the original design online. Best I could find is this Facebook post with a bit of a German soyjak thing going on. Sorry.</p>

<p>Aside from the height reduction and slight recipe adjustments over the years, like substituting gum arabic for gelatin (hence the &ldquo;gum&rdquo; in gummy bear), Goldbears really haven&rsquo;t changed much at all. It ought to be respected for that timelessness, and I really should have started this series here.</p>

<p>Each bear has just over a gram of sugar (~14g per 13 pieces to be precise) which is unremarkable if not a little much considering how small they are. There are, of course, five flavors: red, green, orange, yellow, and clear.</p>

<p>Officially, these are raspberry, strawberry, orange, lemon, and pineapple respectively. I have been scowering the web looking for some legitimate popularity poll of these flavors because I feel like every person I&rsquo;ve asked shares a different opinion. Haribo should probably host one themselves because I&rsquo;d really like to know.</p>
<p>The order above was what I <em>thought</em> my personal ranking would be. Going through them individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red has a really nice tartness to it that, in combination with the sweet berry flavor, makes it stand out the most to me.</li>
<li>Green lacks such tartness but is also probably the sweetest and cleanest flavor of the bunch.
Between the two, I&rsquo;d say green is more enjoyable while chewing whereas red really hits its stride in its aftertaste.</li>
<li>Orange does a commendable job at replicating its intended taste but compared to the others is quite overpowering. Goldbears generally offer a more subtle flavor profile but orange unfortunately bucks that consistency.</li>
<li>Yellow was a surprisingly sweet lemon flavor that I enjoyed more than I was anticipating but left an ever-so-slightly bitter, artificial aftertaste.</li>
<li>Clear was similarly more pleasant than I remember, but I&rsquo;m still left questioning it&rsquo;s inclusion over more standard fruity flavors like grape, cherry, green apple or watermelon. It mostly feels like an opportunity cost because the pineapple flavor is only really distinguishable in the aftertaste.</li>
</ul>
<p>A conclusive ranking for me would likely go as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Red (Raspberry)</li>
<li>Green (Strawberry)</li>
<li>Yellow (Lemon)</li>
<li>Clear (Pineapple)</li>
<li>Orange</li>
</ol>

<p>The gummies themselves are extremely consistent in presentation and manufacturing. However, the representation of each flavor is&hellip; a mixed bag. Sorry. I don&rsquo;t know how to deliver a good pun over text without it reading straight out of 2010s Tumblr. Universally, Haribo gummies are slightly greasy. Nothing egregeous, but it&rsquo;s not something they should be proud of. One piece of advice I&rsquo;ll give is to really chew into these before swallowing. I ended up getting a lot better appreciation for their flavors this way.</p>
<p>All that said, it&rsquo;s hard to hate on Goldbears. They&rsquo;ve stuck around this long for good reason, and without them, there is no Sweet Synopsis.</p>

<p>Arabic translator says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>79 grams of sugar in the whole bitch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot! I can&rsquo;t give exact per-ribbon counts cause I&rsquo;m not about to count how many there are in the package but it&rsquo;s safe to say that sugar counts are high.</p>

<p>I need a better camera setup but it&rsquo;s fine for now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some good Saure Drachenzungen! Despite how it may look the sugar coating doesn&rsquo;t actually provide any immediate sweetness or flavor for that matter, so the first two or so seconds is kind of nothing. As soon as I chewed into it though, that saure hit me like a truck. Like holy shit these are STRONG.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good strong though. Damn good! It overpowers the sweeter, subtler raspberry flavor, but not to a point where that sweetness is missed. It&rsquo;s good, and it lingers for quite a while after the ribbon&rsquo;s gone.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s honestly a lot in the package, and I found the pace at which I ate them to be relatively slow. I almost needed time for the tartness to cool down between ribbons. That&rsquo;s a good thing though &ndash; slower means more time to appreciate the candy. I&rsquo;ll never complain about candy that earns its runtime, if you will.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 4½ bangins</h2>
<h2> ★★★★⯪</h2>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
    Strong flavor that remains after finished.
</li>

We&rsquo;re either celebrating the 4th, a handful of birthdays, or both. It&rsquo;s always in July so it serves as a good checkpoint in my recent years.</p>
<p>In July of 2023, I was at the lowest point of my entire life. Graduation was looming with my post-education future in complete fog. I was in the dead middle of an
internship doing work I despised, hundred of miles away from home. Internally, I was paralyzed. Stuck in place by magnetic forces of suicidal trepidation and ideation, I feared death, but I feared the future just as much. My aunt and uncle invited me to spend the 4th with them and offered to take my cousins and me to the beach. If I recall, I was hesitant, allowing that paralysis to speak on my behalf. They were my only family in a country mile though, so as strong as those forces were, I knew better than to avoid family.</p>
<p>It was a fun weekend. I probably needed it more than I let on, though my Uncle saw through any mask I tried to wear. We talked for a long time, and while I don&rsquo;t remember everything that was said, one bit stuck with me. I can&rsquo;t give an exact quote, but it went something along the lines of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life-long happiness isn&rsquo;t attainable. I&rsquo;ve found happiness in fleeting moments, but in my day to day, I&rsquo;m not happy. I&rsquo;m content with my life, but I&rsquo;m not happy, and I don&rsquo;t expect to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think in the moment, I didn&rsquo;t want to believe him. Even still, there&rsquo;s a part of me that just refuses to let such a hope die. But if I had to guess, he&rsquo;s probably right. In that case, I hope to one day be content with my life. I don&rsquo;t want to keep moving the goalpost down the field, expecting the next milestone in my life to finally be the one to do it. I want to learn to be content with my life right now, in my last moments, and at every point in-between.</p>
<p>Moving forward a year to July of 2024, I was in a radically different position in life. Now knowing concretely the next two years of my life to be spent in graduate school, all the while surrounded by the close friends I&rsquo;d made, my gaze was towards the sky. This time the whole extended family was here, and with nothing weighing me down, I could appreciate that time with my family to the fullest.</p>
<p>Even still, turning 22, I was once again afraid of losing what I had in that current moment. I&rsquo;d always expected life to flow in waves, and at least in my adulthood, it has. Good times are always eventually succeeded by darker ones, and back it goes to the median. The amplitudes, periods, and frequencies of such waves vary greatly, but what comes up always comes down&mdash;and come down things certainly did.</p>
<p>This year I find myself turning 23. In many regards, I feel right in between the extremes of the last two years, but my year thus far has largely mimicked the former. Life took its turn as quick as Winter turned to Spring, and I&rsquo;ve been desparately fighting for balance the whole year. I trust that things are trending upwards.</p>
<p>By the start of the Fall semester, I will have new horizons to look towards. I&rsquo;m leaving for Japan in September, so I want to spend as much time as possible with my friends and family in the coming weeks. After my arrival, I only have five more months until I close this chapter of my life. I want to be prepared for whatever awaits me, but I don&rsquo;t think I even know what exactly that means. No doubt, I will find out in due time.</p>

<p>Today I opened my YouTube to find a new minecraft update announcement at the top of my recommended.
Ironically, I had another topic I planned on writing about today that was also Minecraft-related, but that will have to wait.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=542rY0DQHIM">latest update video</a>, Mojang has given copper a handful of new use cases.
For the purposes of this discussion, the one standout announcement is that of <strong>copper tools and armor</strong>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious discussion to be had here. Where exactly do I start, though? Minecraft&rsquo;s traditional progression system:</p>

<p>Wood -&gt; Stone -&gt; Iron -&gt; Diamond <strong>-&gt; Netherite</strong></p>
<p>five years and one week ago, and has largely been seen as a successful endeavor. This came in spite of immediate discourse of eroding
tradition and arguing sacrilege for making an ore more powerful than diamond, because, well, <strong>it&rsquo;s diamond!</strong> You can&rsquo;t do that!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of how those takes aged. I&rsquo;m not explicitly rejecting copper&rsquo;s new role, I&rsquo;m more questioning it&rsquo;s potential impact, because
denouncing change for fear of cultural or traditional impact isn&rsquo;t exactly productive. At the time, I think it was right to point out the lack
of direct post-game progression to make use of netherite, because that&rsquo;s exactly what we ended up with in following updates (the warden, tricky trials, etc.).</p>
<p>So what happens when the new ore slots squarely <em>within</em> the existing progression?</p>

<p>Wood -&gt; Stone <strong>-&gt; Copper -&gt;</strong> Iron -&gt; Diamond -&gt; Netherite</p>
<p>Honestly, probably not much, but it may depend on the level of player you are. I&rsquo;d wager seasoned players get to iron well within the first hour of starting a world,
so was there really a gap to address? There may be, and time will tell, but I doubt many people were pining Mojang to close the gap between stone and iron. The issue
is more so that copper is useless, which isn&rsquo;t a strong case for effectively diluting the very solid pace of progression Minecraft&rsquo;s ore system has demonstrably proven.</p>
<p>In a way, it feels like they&rsquo;re backtracking. For all intents and purposes, if Mojang had strong conviction that copper&rsquo;s purpose was, at least partially, that of an ore for progression,
they wouldn&rsquo;t have waited four years to give them such a role. Rewatching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBvZ2Iqmm3M">Caves &amp; Cliffs First Look</a>, Vanilla Minecraft Game Director
Agnes Larsson states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I got inspired by the pretty copper roofs in Stockholm, and they are all green because we have so many old buildings there. We actually added
that mechanic to Minecraft&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s so cool because it actually adds history to Minecraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that copper was always positioned as a building ore, but now Mojang feels the need to justify the sheer amount of it you find within caves by transitioning it&rsquo;s role
to one of more general purpose, à la iron or gold. A similar thing happened with Lapis quite some time ago, albeit to a far lesser extent.</p>
<p>Lapis didn&rsquo;t get armor or tools, but it did see the entire enchantment system reworked alongside it. That panned out well, so this very well may too.
I&rsquo;m just struggling to find the merit in this specific use case for copper. It feels like Mojang is casually toying with one of Minecraft&rsquo;s most tried strengths in an attempt to justify a past
miscalculation.</p>

<p>Anyways, Sweet Tarts (stylized SweeTARTS, for some reason) is everywhere, and I&rsquo;m pretty
sure the same goes for Fruity Splitz, their main gummy line. You&rsquo;re gonna hear this sentiment a lot
from me, but I like some of the Sweet Tarts products &ndash; what the fuck do they know about gummies?</p>

<p>Not much.</p>
<p>Though, I will give them props for the size of this package. Less gigantic bags, the better.
More candy brands need to expand their products to smaller offerings &ndash; specifically gummy brands. The
checkout counter is dominated by candy bars and gum, but I think there&rsquo;s a market for small package gummies.</p>
<p>Cudos for that, Sweet Tarts.</p>

<p>30 pieces, 270 calories, 42g of sugar. 1.5g of sugar per gummy, which is&hellip; fine I guess. You&rsquo;re not
gonna see anything compare to the low sugar density of <a href="https://leespeak.me/sweet_synopsis/mario_gummies/">foreign candy</a>.</p>

<p>The flavors are as standard as they come, which is no surprise since they just contextualized the flavors of

<p>Cherry, Apple, Lemon, Orange, and Grape are all here, but out of the 30 gummies, I didn&rsquo;t get a single blue peach.
It&rsquo;s disappointing since it&rsquo;s the only interesting flavor here, at least going off name.</p>

<p>Can you see the grease? I can certainly feel it. This is what ultimately ruins this gummy for me: they&rsquo;re so damn greasy.
Like, it&rsquo;s immediately on your fingers and you can&rsquo;t chew on them without feeling it.</p>
<p>Consistency is alright. The top and bottom halves give the same bite, one just has the appearance of transparency.
They&rsquo;re really the same feeling, though. Not too tough, slightly mushy, but the grease really just distracts from the bite.</p>
<p>The flavors are good; granted, none of them are new and all are just ripped from the original product. Taste is king, though,
so they earn considerable points here.</p>
<p>Lastly, as hinted at prior, the manufacturing really leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see the price tag until it got rung up and in the moment, all I wanted was to <em>not</em> look broke and lame. I panicked
and not only bought the gummies, but happily took the 2 for $30 deal on geek bars with money that wasn&rsquo;t mine. I also forgot to
look at the expiration date. Granted, it&rsquo;s not like they were selling year past expired candy. Surely.</p>

<p>Ok well it&rsquo;s not a year past expired. It&rsquo;s eight months and those four can make all the difference I hope. Astute readers will have
already noticed this.</p>

<p>As part of the formalities, each gummy has 0.3 grams of sugar. There are 19 gummies in the bag, which gives us an extremely
impressive 5.7 grams of sugar in the entire package. As more of these are released, you&rsquo;ll see just how incredible that stat is.
American nutrition facts don&rsquo;t give decimal values, so that is also appreciated here. 0.3g turns into &lt;1g which is just stupid
and uninformative.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the &ldquo;Shelf Life: 10 Months&rdquo; at the bottom. I&rsquo;m praying that I&rsquo;ll never have to review another piece of candy
that&rsquo;s a year and a half old.</p>
<p>Opening the bag delivered an intensely stiff scent of melon. It&rsquo;s to be expected but damn was it strong. If you see a flavored food
in Japan that&rsquo;s colored green, there&rsquo;s a 99% chance it&rsquo;s melon flavored.</p>

<p>These are no doubt all just reused renders of the characters but it&rsquo;s still very cute. I recognize quite a few of them, like the
Mario 3D World one right from the bottom left, and the mario party one to the right of that. I&rsquo;m gonna try the odd red out on the
far left.</p>

<p>This feels like a bad omen, but it&rsquo;s one I signed up for.</p>
<p>I mentioned the green was most definitely melon from the smell. As for the other flavor: I had probably subconsciously read this
on the English part of the packaging and forgot, but I correctly guessed it was cola. I can&rsquo;t read japanese. Astute readers will
have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Anyways, I won&rsquo;t be saying this ever again to be clear, but in the spirit of the episode&hellip; itadakimasu.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; a hard swallow. The inside is actually really good, which gives me the impression that if these
weren&rsquo;t crusted and 18 months old, I&rsquo;d be having a great time. I should reiterate how impressive it is that they&rsquo;re plenty sweet
and have a fifth of the sugar the next episode&rsquo;s subject has.</p>

<p>The melon flavor was alright. It&rsquo;s standard melon flavor, but I&rsquo;m just not super partial towards it.</p>
<p>I got a mushroom too, which makes me think how many other shapes are in here. On the packaging, they only advertise a Mario and
a Yoshi. Astute readers will have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Finishing that one off I realized that I really don&rsquo;t want to eat these anymore. The only reasonable thing to do, then, is to open
up all the remaining pieces to see which gummy shapes I get.</p>

<p>I found one more! A koopa shell, or I guess it&rsquo;d be a green shell like how the mushroom is a red mushroom. Maybe the idea is that
green mario is supposed to be luigi, because shape of gummy has a red and green variant within the games.</p>
<p>As shitty as this lighting is, it actually better represents the color of the gummies. They&rsquo;re not nearly as dark in shade as the
other pictures would suggest.</p>
<p>I dunno. Maybe these would be edible if you cut off the crust shell.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 2 bangins</h2>
<h2> ★★☆☆☆</h2>
<p>Like all Sweet Synopsis reviews, we start with a base of 2½ bangins.</p>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>

when it comes to game updates. Like, I get it, they don&rsquo;t want to change the game too much and risk undermining
the core identity of the game, but there&rsquo;s so much that notion alone doesn&rsquo;t account for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bullshit to begin with &ndash; I mean in practice, Mojang has done plenty to rip away the core of Minecraft as
an experience. The game was built on dynamic systems and, in the beginning, had its identity entrenched in
multifaceted mechanics and items. At some point we started getting a slew of updates with one-off ideas that
failed to contribute to the greater dynamic gameplay of the game&rsquo;s foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s add a mob called the sniffer that only has use for a brand new entirely superficial fossil digging
mechanic. For the <em>lore</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t honestly tell how much mojang cares about maintaining the game&rsquo;s identity. If that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going for,
they&rsquo;re not doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Regardless, the game has bugs that haven&rsquo;t been addressed for over a decade (see <a href="https://bugs-legacy.mojang.com/browse/MC-1794?attachmentSortBy=fileName&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">item stitching</a>, for example).</p>

<p>Thankfully there are an endless number of mods that can account for mojang&rsquo;s inaction. And this is where it hit me
&ndash; does Mojang not see bugs as issues so long as someone in the community fixes it for them? Even further, does this
extend to actual game features? I mean, surely overhauls like sodium and optifine takes the onus off them to optimize
their game.</p>
<p>So here goes the theory: <strong>Mojang does not care to do any work that has not already been done for them.</strong> If a mod has
done so, then their hands are clean. They don&rsquo;t even need to implement it themselves! Just quietly let each unsatisfied
player shuffle over to fabric and forge and figure it out themselves. It&rsquo;s genius, really.</p>

<p>I truly doubt I’ll ever find the words to properly describe how this album makes me feel, but I’m going to try anyway.</p>
<p>Death is scary, comforting, and inevitable. Its arrival is not supposed to be up to us, and that unpredictability is something that innately terrorizes us all. Therein lies this unique solace in the temptation of suicide: removing the uncertainty of the when and the how by freely deciding so for yourself. But nothing is free—the relief found in suicidal ideation is offset by the paralyzing fear of regret. In one way or another, we are haunted.</p>
<p>The cold, delicate and debilitating emotions at the core of this album’s premise demand to be taken seriously. There’s no room for contrivance or cliché here, which makes Quadeca’s sincerity and sensitivity all the more valuable. I’m no doubt sounding pretentious when I put it this way, but art like this saves people; it saved me.</p>
<p>I Didn’t Mean to Haunt You is special. It’s special to me, obviously, but that’s not what I’m getting at. In conception and ambition, in composition and articulation, in cogency and authenticity—in totality, it is special. This album deserves to be heard, and deserves to be remembered.</p>

do little to obscure <br>
do little to drown out <br>
the invasive species seizing my attention <br>
but it can still pacify the chaos <br>
it uses alternative methods <br>
slowly, inconspicuously, yet unmistakibly making headway <br>
directing us, fulfilling the natural order <br>
the will of the universe <br>
one musn&rsquo;t attempt to decipher a destination <br>
you&rsquo;ll never be faster than the waves of light that color our existence <br>

in acceptance <br>
in appreciation <br>
for the priceless opportunity <br>
to feel those calm winds</p>

would your words ring loud throughout the crowd <br>
or fail to make a sway <br>
would you peer back out at the eyes of the inimical <br>
or quiver in fear of judgement from the critical <br>
are you speaking for yourself? or those in need of help? <br>
maybe you&rsquo;d pander, as a means to an end <br>
seek approval en absolute, make your vanity resolute <br>
perhaps there&rsquo;s no need, your ego not depend <br>
are you scared of the prejudice? the preconceived conclusions? <br>
or is it the incredulous? the pompous disillusioned? <br>
whatever it may be, understand its unabating <br>
detractors detract, so long as there&rsquo;s debating <br>
so worry not what you can&rsquo;t change, or have no in to say <br>
the subject that takes precedence is the message you relay <br>
that world whose notice you take hold <br>
is anything but fiction <br>
a hypothetical this has been sold <br>
but there&rsquo;s purpose to this diction <br>
those defined in your own world will serve as your beholders <br>
that crowd is waiting for your word, observing what&rsquo;s unfolding <br>
so don&rsquo;t be timid, tenuous, or too scared to impart <br>
give them something genuine, something from the heart</p>

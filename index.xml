<p>Today I opened my YouTube to find a new minecraft update announcement at the top of my recommended.
Ironically, I had another topic I planned on writing about today that was also Minecraft-related, but that will have to wait.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=542rY0DQHIM">latest update video</a>, Mojang has given copper a handful of new use cases.
For the purposes of this discussion, the one standout announcement is that of <strong>copper tools and armor</strong>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an obvious discussion to be had here. Where exactly do I start, though? Minecraft&rsquo;s traditional progression system:</p>

<p>Wood -&gt; Stone -&gt; Iron -&gt; Diamond <strong>-&gt; Netherite</strong></p>
<p>five years and one week ago, and has largely been seen as a successful endeavor. This came in spite of immediate discourse of eroding
tradition and arguing sacrilege for making an ore more powerful than diamond, because, well, <strong>it&rsquo;s diamond!</strong> You can&rsquo;t do that!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of how those takes aged. I&rsquo;m not explicitly rejecting copper&rsquo;s new role, I&rsquo;m more questioning it&rsquo;s potential impact, because
denouncing change for fear of cultural or traditional impact isn&rsquo;t exactly productive. At the time, I think it was right to point out the lack
of direct post-game progression to make use of netherite, because that&rsquo;s exactly what we ended up with in following updates (the warden, tricky trials, etc.).</p>
<p>So what happens when the new ore slots squarely <em>within</em> the existing progression?</p>

<p>Wood -&gt; Stone <strong>-&gt; Copper -&gt;</strong> Iron -&gt; Diamond -&gt; Netherite</p>
<p>Honestly, probably not much, but it may depend on the level of player you are. I&rsquo;d wager seasoned players get to iron well within the first hour of starting a world,
so was there really a gap to address? There may be, and time will tell, but I doubt many people were pining Mojang to close the gap between stone and iron. The issue
is more so that copper is useless, which isn&rsquo;t a strong case for effectively diluting the very solid pace of progression Minecraft&rsquo;s ore system has demonstrably proven.</p>
<p>In a way, it feels like they&rsquo;re backtracking. For all intents and purposes, if Mojang had strong conviction that copper&rsquo;s purpose was, at least partially, that of an ore for progression,
they wouldn&rsquo;t have waited four years to give them such a role. Rewatching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBvZ2Iqmm3M">Caves &amp; Cliffs First Look</a>, Vanilla Minecraft Game Director
Agnes Larsson states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I got inspired by the pretty copper roofs in Stockholm, and they are all green because we have so many old buildings there. We actually added
that mechanic to Minecraft&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s so cool because it actually adds history to Minecraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that copper was always positioned as a building ore, but now Mojang feels the need to justify the sheer amount of it you find within caves by transitioning it&rsquo;s role
to one of more general purpose, à la iron or gold. A similar thing happened with Lapis quite some time ago, albeit to a far lesser extent.</p>
<p>Lapis didn&rsquo;t get armor or tools, but it did see the entire enchantment system reworked alongside it. That panned out well, so this very well may too.
I&rsquo;m just struggling to find the merit in this specific use case for copper. It feels like Mojang is casually toying with one of Minecraft&rsquo;s most tried strengths in an attempt to justify a past
miscalculation.</p>

<p>Anyways, Sweet Tarts (stylized SweeTARTS, for some reason) is everywhere, and I&rsquo;m pretty
sure the same goes for Fruity Splitz, their main gummy line. You&rsquo;re gonna hear this sentiment a lot
from me, but I like some of the Sweet Tarts products &ndash; what the fuck do they know about gummies?</p>

<p>Not much.</p>
<p>Though, I will give them props for the size of this package. Less gigantic bags, the better.
More candy brands need to expand their products to smaller offerings &ndash; specifically gummy brands. The
checkout counter is dominated by candy bars and gum, but I think there&rsquo;s a market for small package gummies.</p>
<p>Cudos for that, Sweet Tarts.</p>

<p>30 pieces, 270 calories, 42g of sugar. 1.5g of sugar per gummy, which is&hellip; fine I guess. You&rsquo;re not
gonna see anything compare to the low sugar density of <a href="https://lee_speak.me/sweet_synopsis/mario_gummies/">foreign candy</a>.</p>

<p>Cherry, Apple, Lemon, Orange, and Grape are all here, but out of the 30 gummies, I didn&rsquo;t get a single blue peach.
It&rsquo;s disappointing since it&rsquo;s the only interesting flavor here, at least going off name.</p>

<p>Can you see the grease? I can certainly feel it. This is what ultimately ruins this gummy for me: they&rsquo;re so damn greasy.
Like, it&rsquo;s immediately on your fingers and you can&rsquo;t chew on them without feeling it.</p>
<p>Consistency is alright. The top and bottom halves give the same bite, one just has the appearance of transparency.
They&rsquo;re really the same feeling, though. Not too tough, slightly mushy, but the grease really just distracts from the bite.</p>
<p>The flavors are good; granted, none of them are new and all are just ripped from the original product. Taste is king, though,
so they earn considerable points here.</p>
<p>Lastly, as hinted at prior, the manufacturing really leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think my first official Sweet Synopsis review would be on a $13 Japanese import I found at a smoke shop.

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see the price tag until it got rung up and in the moment, all I wanted was to <em>not</em> look broke and lame. I panicked
and not only bought the gummies, but happily took the 2 for $30 deal on geek bars with money that wasn&rsquo;t mine. I also forgot to
look at the expiration date. Granted, it&rsquo;s not like they were selling year past expired candy. Surely.</p>

<p>Ok well it&rsquo;s not a year past expired. It&rsquo;s eight months and those four can make all the difference I hope. Astute readers will have
already noticed this.</p>

<p>As part of the formalities, each gummy has 0.3 grams of sugar. There are 19 gummies in the bag, which gives us an extremely
impressive 5.7 grams of sugar in the entire package. As more of these are released, you&rsquo;ll see just how incredible that stat is.
American nutrition facts don&rsquo;t give decimal values, so that is also appreciated here. 0.3g turns into &lt;1g which is just stupid
and uninformative.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the &ldquo;Shelf Life: 10 Months&rdquo; at the bottom. I&rsquo;m praying that I&rsquo;ll never have to review another piece of candy
that&rsquo;s a year and a half old.</p>
<p>Opening the bag delivered an intensely stiff scent of melon. It&rsquo;s to be expected but damn was it strong. If you see a flavored food
in Japan that&rsquo;s colored green, there&rsquo;s a 99% chance it&rsquo;s melon flavored.</p>

<p>These are no doubt all just reused renders of the characters but it&rsquo;s still very cute. I recognize quite a few of them, like the
Mario 3D World one right from the bottom left, and the mario party one to the right of that. I&rsquo;m gonna try the odd red out on the
far left.</p>

  "
/>

<p>This feels like a bad omen, but it&rsquo;s one I signed up for.</p>
<p>I mentioned the green was most definitely melon from the smell. As for the other flavor: I had probably subconsciously read this
on the English part of the packaging and forgot, but I correctly guessed it was cola. I can&rsquo;t read japanese. Astute readers will
have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Anyways, I won&rsquo;t be saying this ever again to be clear, but in the spirit of the episode&hellip; itadakimasu.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; a hard swallow. The inside is actually really good, which gives me the impression that if these
weren&rsquo;t crusted and 18 months old, I&rsquo;d be having a great time. I should reiterate how impressive it is that they&rsquo;re plenty sweet
and have a fifth of the sugar the next episode&rsquo;s subject has.</p>

<p>The melon flavor was alright. It&rsquo;s standard melon flavor, but I&rsquo;m just not super partial towards it.</p>
<p>I got a mushroom too, which makes me think how many other shapes are in here. On the packaging, they only advertise a Mario and
a Yoshi. Astute readers will have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Finishing that one off I realized that I really don&rsquo;t want to eat these anymore. The only reasonable thing to do, then, is to open
up all the remaining pieces to see which gummy shapes I get.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the boy. Just as decrepit as I remember :)</p>

<p>I think I hear someone faintly whispering something like &ldquo;Killlll meeeeeee.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m definitely not eating him if that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s
asking.</p>

<p>Just wanted to reiterate how FUCKING OLD THESE THINGS ARE.</p>
<p>Anyways, with all of them opened, I have the complete roundup.</p>

<p>I found one more! A koopa shell, or I guess it&rsquo;d be a green shell like how the mushroom is a red mushroom. Maybe the idea is that
green mario is supposed to be luigi, because shape of gummy has a red and green variant within the games.</p>
<p>As shitty as this lighting is, it actually better represents the color of the gummies. They&rsquo;re not nearly as dark in shade as the
other pictures would suggest.</p>
<p>I dunno. Maybe these would be edible if you cut off the crust shell.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 2 bangins</h2>
<h2> ★★☆☆☆</h2>
<p>Like all Sweet Synopsis reviews, we start with a base of 2½ bangins.</p>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +1: Neat rare shapes.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +½: Cute packaging renders.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +½: Low amount of high quality sugar.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +½: Good, standard cola flavoring.
</li>
<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -2½: The age/crust.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -1½: The price.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -½: Melon flavoring is just not my favorite.
</li>
<h2> Recommendation: ☹👎︎</h2>
<p>Only if you&rsquo;re in japan. If you can find them cheap and relatively fresh, they&rsquo;re well worth it.</p>

when it comes to game updates. Like, I get it, they don&rsquo;t want to change the game too much and risk undermining
the core identity of the game, but there&rsquo;s so much that notion alone doesn&rsquo;t account for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bullshit to begin with &ndash; I mean in practice, Mojang has done plenty to rip away the core of Minecraft as
an experience. The game was built on dynamic systems and, in the beginning, had its identity entrenched in
multifaceted mechanics and items. At some point we started getting a slew of updates with one-off ideas that
failed to contribute to the greater dynamic gameplay of the game&rsquo;s foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s add a mob called the sniffer that only has use for a brand new entirely superficial fossil digging
mechanic. For the <em>lore</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t honestly tell how much mojang cares about maintaining the game&rsquo;s identity. If that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going for,
they&rsquo;re not doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Regardless, the game has bugs that haven&rsquo;t been addressed for over a decade (see <a href="https://bugs-legacy.mojang.com/browse/MC-1794?attachmentSortBy=fileName&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">item stitching</a>, for example).</p>

<p>Thankfully there are an endless number of mods that can account for mojang&rsquo;s inaction. And this is where it hit me
&ndash; does Mojang not see bugs as issues so long as someone in the community fixes it for them? Even further, does this
extend to actual game features? I mean, surely overhauls like sodium and optifine takes the onus off them to optimize
their game.</p>
<p>So here goes the theory: <strong>Mojang does not care to do any work that has not already been done for them.</strong> If a mod has
done so, then their hands are clean. They don&rsquo;t even need to implement it themselves! Just quietly let each unsatisfied
player shuffle over to fabric and forge and figure it out themselves. It&rsquo;s genius, really.</p>

<p>I truly doubt I’ll ever find the words to properly describe how this album makes me feel, but I’m going to try anyway.</p>
<p>Death is scary, comforting, and inevitable. Its arrival is not supposed to be up to us, and that unpredictability is something that innately terrorizes us all. Therein lies this unique solace in the temptation of suicide: removing the uncertainty of the when and the how by freely deciding so for yourself. But nothing is free—the relief found in suicidal ideation is offset by the paralyzing fear of regret. In one way or another, we are haunted.</p>
<p>The cold, delicate and debilitating emotions at the core of this album’s premise demand to be taken seriously. There’s no room for contrivance or cliché here, which makes Quadeca’s sincerity and sensitivity all the more valuable. I’m no doubt sounding pretentious when I put it this way, but art like this saves people; it saved me.</p>
<p>I Didn’t Mean to Haunt You is special. It’s special to me, obviously, but that’s not what I’m getting at. In conception and ambition, in composition and articulation, in cogency and authenticity—in totality, it is special. This album deserves to be heard, and deserves to be remembered.</p>

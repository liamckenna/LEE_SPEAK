    "comment": "i feel like this could open doors towards more challenges that can occur faster due to an intermediate material that can be dropped in the overworld (via drowns) as opposed to being mined. This would allow the player to go from wood straight to copper without having to ever go mining which I think can be applied creatively in the future. In a traditional Minecraft playthrough sense, copper tools are kinda stupid tho",

For challenge maps, yeah that may be cool. But yes, in normal gameplay it likely wouldn't happen",

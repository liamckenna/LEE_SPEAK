all the more valuable. I’m no doubt sounding pretentious when I put it this way, but art like this saves people; it saved me.

I Didn’t Mean to Haunt You is special. It’s special to me, obviously, but that’s not what I’m getting at. In conception and ambition, in composition and articulation, in cogency and authenticity—in totality, it is special. This album deserves to be heard, and deserves to be remembered.

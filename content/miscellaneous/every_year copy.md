Calm winds <br>
do little to obscure <br>
do little to drown out <br>
the invasive species seizing my attention <br>
but it can still pacify the chaos <br>
it uses alternative methods <br>
slowly, inconspicuously, yet unmistakibly making headway <br>
directing us, fulfilling the natural order <br>
the will of the universe <br>
one musn't attempt to decipher a destination <br>
you'll nevewr be faster than the waves of light that color our existence <br>
but peace can be found <br>
in acceptance <br>
in appreciation <br>
for the priceless opportunity <br>
to feel those calm winds

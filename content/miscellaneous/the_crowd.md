if you had the world's attention, what would you say? <br>
would your words ring loud throughout the crowd <br>
or fail to make a sway <br>
would you peer back out at the eyes of the inimical <br>
or quiver in fear of judgement from the critical <br>
are you speaking for yourself? or those in need of help? <br>
maybe you'd pander, as a means to an end <br>
seek approval en absolute, make your vanity resolute <br>
perhaps there's no need, your ego not depend <br>
are you scared of the prejudice? the preconceived conclusions? <br>
or is it the incredulous? the pompous disillusioned? <br>
whatever it may be, understand its unabating <br>
detractors detract, so long as there's debating <br>
so worry not what you can't change, or have no in to say <br>
the subject that takes precedence is the message you relay <br>
that world whose notice you take hold <br>
is anything but fiction <br>
a hypothetical this has been sold <br>
but there's purpose to this diction <br>
those defined in your own world will serve as your beholders <br>
that crowd is waiting for your word, observing what's unfolding <br>
so don't be timid, tenuous, or too scared to impart <br>
give them something genuine, something from the heart

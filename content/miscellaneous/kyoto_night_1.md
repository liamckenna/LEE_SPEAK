2025 <br>
1 A.M. <br>
On the bus exiting the airport <br>
In a foreign country <br>
Surrounded by strangers <br>
I have found a familiar feeling.

2020 <br>
1 A.M. <br>
Walking along a hiking trail <br>
In an foreign state <br>
Surrounded by strangers <br>
It’s not a bad feeling.

That’s not to say it’s pure bliss, but it is exhilarating. <br>
And guttural. <br>
Nervewracking. <br>
Such a unique feeling to happen all but a few times in my life. It’s a feeling of uncertainty and hope that occupies my mental. I’m much more composed than I was five years ago, but it’s not often a new chapter in life begins. When it does, you feel it. This time, things read more like a footnote or a side story. Nonetheless, I am surrounded by strangers with whom I will soon enough, assuredly, grow close. It’s all hitting me at once now that I’m finally here. <br>
What an exciting feeling.

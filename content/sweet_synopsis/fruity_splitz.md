I'd like to clear up some things before continuing:


1. Scores are out of 5 bangins


2. Please recommend more candy in the commments!

3. I haven't had a lot of chocolate!
- I specialize in gummy candy, but I'm open to covering chocolate in the future.

4. Final scores start at 2Â½ bangins and go from there.
- They're based foremost on how I feel, then I try to accurately map their qualities to the score
I have in my head.


Anyways, Sweet Tarts (stylized SweeTARTS, for some reason) is everywhere, and I'm pretty
sure the same goes for Fruity Splitz, their main gummy line. You're gonna hear this sentiment a lot
from me, but I like some of the Sweet Tarts products -- what the fuck do they know about gummies?

Not much.

Though, I will give them props for the size of this package. Less gigantic bags, the better.
More candy brands need to expand their products to smaller offerings -- specifically gummy brands. The
checkout counter is dominated by candy bars and gum, but I think there's a market for small package gummies.

Cudos for that, Sweet Tarts.

30 pieces, 270 calories, 42g of sugar. 1.5g of sugar per gummy, which is... fine I guess. You're not 
gonna see anything compare to the low sugar density of [foreign candy](https://lee_speak.me/sweet_synopsis/mario_gummies/).

The flavors are as standard as they come, which is no surprise since they just contextualized the flavors of 
the standard Sweet Tarts.

Cherry, Apple, Lemon, Orange, and Grape are all here, but out of the 30 gummies, I didn't get a single blue peach.
It's disappointing since it's the only interesting flavor here, at least going off name.

Can you see the grease? I can certainly feel it. This is what ultimately ruins this gummy for me: they're so damn greasy.
Like, it's immediately on your fingers and you can't chew on them without feeling it.

Consistency is alright. The top and bottom halves give the same bite, one just has the appearance of transparency.
They're really the same feeling, though. Not too tough, slightly mushy, but the grease really just distracts from the bite.

The flavors are good; granted, none of them are new and all are just ripped from the original product. Taste is king, though, 
so they earn considerable points here.

Lastly, as hinted at prior, the manufacturing really leaves something to be desired.

It gets egregious when an entire flavor is missing, even if it's just one of six.

<h2> Final Score: 2 bangins</h2>
<h2> â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†</h2>

**Positives:**

<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +2: Strong assortment of six flavors.
</li>

**Negatives:**

<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -2: The grease.
</li>

<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -Â½: Poor manufacturing.
</li>

<h2> Recommendation: â˜¹ðŸ‘Žï¸Ž</h2>

Just get regular Sweet Tarts and avoid the grease.

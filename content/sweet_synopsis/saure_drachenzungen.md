Germans everywhere are RAVING about SAURE DRACHENZUNGEN! And non-Germans!

Another import, I don't expect any of you to have already tried or ever try Saure Drachenzungen. But this is my civil duty -- I'm gifted candy, I will review. Thank you Josh, Binny, and Wader.

This is aging quite well. Not to mention I'll be in Japan for the rest of the year, so I can't wait to see all the standard American candy over there. I even had a scrapped Dubai Chocolate review that cost me $20. Good times!

That's a lot! I can't give exact per-ribbon counts cause I'm not about to count how many there are in the package but it's safe to say that sugar counts are high.

I need a better camera setup but it's fine for now.

That's some good Saure Drachenzungen! Despite how it may look the sugar coating doesn't actually provide any immediate sweetness or flavor for that matter, so the first two or so seconds is kind of nothing. As soon as I chewed into it though, that saure hit me like a truck. Like holy shit these are STRONG.

It's a good strong though. Damn good! It overpowers the sweeter, subtler raspberry flavor, but not to a point where that sweetness is missed. It's good, and it lingers for quite a while after the ribbon's gone.

There's honestly a lot in the package, and I found the pace at which I ate them to be relatively slow. I almost needed time for the tartness to cool down between ribbons. That's a good thing though -- slower means more time to appreciate the candy. I'll never complain about candy that earns its runtime, if you will.

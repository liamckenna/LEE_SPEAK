## Welcome!

I'm Liam, a grad student studying Computer Graphics.

At the top you'll find links to the subsections of my 
blog. Gaming, Music, and Miscellaneous are all topics where you're free to browse my unwanted opinions, 
with Sweet Synopsis being a side project I felt right to have hosted here.

LEE_SPEAK was created for a handful of reasons, chiefly that I needed some sort of outlet, but also because
sometimes I have a take that I don't hear coming from anywhere else. Posts here will always be some flavor of
both original and insightful (and sometimes personal).

#### I hate being pitied.

The woman at the front desk saw me crying and offered to heal my pokémon entirely for free. As much as I hate taking handouts, she was saving me like ₽600, which is at least a whole pokeball.

Not that I personally agree, but everyone seems to think I'm weak. I'm not weak, I'm broke, and there's a big difference. TARMANDER{{< sprite firered-leafgreen charmander tight>}} died because that SKRILEX{{< sprite firered-leafgreen weedle tight>}} wanna-be fought dirty. I can fight dirty too.

SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} doesn't remember his family anymore. He doesn't remember how it feels to be loved. His childhood has been robbed from him and I couldn't be more pleased. 
**SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} has bloodlust.**

Anywho, I got a text from Leaf telling me to meet him on the road west of Viridian City at noon. I showed up a couple minutes early because I wanna jump him and take his squirtle{{< sprite firered-leafgreen squirtle tight>}}.

Waiting, waiting, waaiiaiiaiii-

I fell right onto the, the uhh, the um...

The tile flooring? Why is there tile flooring in a grass field?

God damnit.

I knew LEAF was about to start with his bird. Don't ask me how -- it's a trade secret.
Part of what makes me the incredible trainer I am. I remembered watching the first episode
of the anime and how quickly all those sparrows got fried from Ash's pikachu{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}.

I knew exactly who to use. "GO PIKABLUE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}!"

Wrong pokéball. I really should start labeling these things. 

"You got this, LVL 2 RATT{{< sprite firered-leafgreen rattata tight>}}!"

Poor fucker never stood a chance. Didn't really have time to get to know him though, so it's whatever. 

**REST IN PEACE, LVL 2 RATT{{< sprite firered-leafgreen rattata tight>}}.** 

The late rattata gave me enough time to frantically open each pokeball and figure out which one was which.
A beautiful distraction from a true martyr.

**GO, PIKABLUE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}!**

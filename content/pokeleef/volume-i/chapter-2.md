#### I hate being pitied.

The woman at the front desk saw me crying and offered to heal my pokémon entirely for free. As much as I hate taking handouts, she was saving me like ₽600, which is at least a whole pokeball.

Not that I personally agree, but everyone seems to think I'm weak. I'm not weak, I'm broke, and there's a big difference. TARMANDER{{< sprite firered-leafgreen charmander tight>}} died because that SKRILEX{{< sprite firered-leafgreen weedle tight>}} wanna-be fought dirty. I can fight dirty too.

SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} doesn't remember his family anymore. He doesn't remember how it feels to be loved. His childhood has been robbed from him and I couldn't be more pleased.

**SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} has bloodlust.**


Anywho, I got a text from Leaf telling me to meet him on the road west of Viridian City at noon. I showed up a couple minutes early because I wanna jump him and take his Squirtle{{< sprite firered-leafgreen squirtle tight>}}.

Waiting, waiting, waaiiaiiaiii-

I fell right onto the, the uhh, the um...

The tile flooring? Why is there tile flooring in a grass field?

Damnit.

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/5.3.png" scale="2" >}}

I knew LEAF was about to start with his bird. Don't ask me how -- it's a trade secret.
Part of what makes me the incredible trainer I am. I remembered watching the first episode
of the anime and how quickly all those sparrows got fried from Ash's Pikachu{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}.

I knew exactly who to use. "GO PIKABLUE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}!"



{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/5.6.png" scale="2" >}}

Wrong pokéball. I really should start labeling these things. 

"You got this, LVL 2 RATT{{< sprite firered-leafgreen rattata tight>}}!"

<div style="display: flex; gap: 0; align-items: flex-start;">
{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/6.1.png" >}}

Poor fucker never stood a chance. Didn't really have time to get to know him though, so it's whatever. 

**REST IN PEACE, LVL 2 RATT{{< sprite firered-leafgreen rattata tight>}}.** 

The late rattata gave me enough time to frantically open each pokeball and figure out which one was which.
A beautiful distraction from a true martyr.

**GO, PIKABLUE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}!**

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/7.1.png" scale="2" >}}

"THUNDERSHOCK!"

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/8.1.png" scale="2" >}}


Just like in the movies, PIKABLUE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen pikachu tight>}}.

Out came that Squirtle{{< sprite firered-leafgreen squirtle tight>}}.

"THUNDERSHOCK again!" I said, praying for a paralysis.

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/9.1.png" scale="2" >}}

GOD IS REAL AND THIS WAS CHANCE TO SHOW HIM WHAT I'M MADE OF. I WANTED THAT SQUIRTLE{{< sprite firered-leafgreen squirtle tight>}}
FOR MYSELF AND THIS IS THE PERFECT CHANCE.

I ran onto the battlefield without a second thought. Maybe I should have though, because 
right as I picked up my grand prize...

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/10.1.png" scale="2" >}}

My left leg is still numb. Thankfully, LEAF was on his phone and missed the stunt
I tried to pull. I limped back to my trainer position in time before he looked up
and saw his dead Squirtle{{< sprite firered-leafgreen squirtle tight>}}. 

{{< screenshot src="/images/pokeleef/volume-i/chapter-2/10.2.png" scale="2" >}}

Hah. It wasn't luck, moron. The only person who got lucky was you. If I got my hands
on your turtle I would've been unstoppable. 

I wonder if I can buy one with the ₽1000 I got for winning.

POKéMON LEAGUE, here I come!

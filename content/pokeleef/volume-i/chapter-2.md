#### I hate being pitied.

The woman at the front desk saw me crying and offered to heal my pokémon entirely for free. As much as I hate taking handouts, she is saving me like ₽600, which is at least a whole pokeball.

Not that I personally agree, but everyone seems to think I'm weak. I'm not weak, I'm broke, and there's a big difference. TARMANDER{{< sprite firered-leafgreen charmander tight>}} died because that SKRILEX{{< sprite firered-leafgreen weedle tight>}} wanna-be fought dirty. I can fight dirty too.

SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} doesn't remember his family anymore. He doesn't remember how it feels to be loved. His childhood has been robbed from him and I couldn't be more pleased. 
**SKRILEX {{< sprite firered-leafgreen beedrill tight>}} has bloodlust.**

Poor fucker never stood a chance. Didn't really have time to get to know him though, so it's whatever. 

**REST IN PEACE, LVL 2 RATT{{< sprite firered-leafgreen rattata tight>}}.** 

You gave me enough time to find the right pokéball. What a beautiful distraction.

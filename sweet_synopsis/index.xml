<p>Anyways, Sweet Tarts (stylized SweeTARTS, for some reason) is everywhere, and I&rsquo;m pretty
sure the same goes for Fruity Splitz, their main gummy line. You&rsquo;re gonna hear this sentiment a lot
from me, but I like some of the Sweet Tarts products &ndash; what the fuck do they know about gummies?</p>

<p>Not much.</p>
<p>Though, I will give them props for the size of this package. Less gigantic bags, the better.
More candy brands need to expand their products to smaller offerings &ndash; specifically gummy brands. The
checkout counter is dominated by candy bars and gum, but I think there&rsquo;s a market for small package gummies.</p>
<p>Cudos for that, Sweet Tarts.</p>

<p>30 pieces, 270 calories, 42g of sugar. 1.5g of sugar per gummy, which is&hellip; fine I guess. You&rsquo;re not
gonna see anything compare to the low sugar density of <a href="https://leespeak.me/sweet_synopsis/mario_gummies/">foreign candy</a>.</p>

<p>The flavors are as standard as they come, which is no surprise since they just contextualized the flavors of
the standard Sweet Tarts.</p>

<p>Cherry, Apple, Lemon, Orange, and Grape are all here, but out of the 30 gummies, I didn&rsquo;t get a single blue peach.
It&rsquo;s disappointing since it&rsquo;s the only interesting flavor here, at least going off name.</p>

<p>Can you see the grease? I can certainly feel it. This is what ultimately ruins this gummy for me: they&rsquo;re so damn greasy.
Like, it&rsquo;s immediately on your fingers and you can&rsquo;t chew on them without feeling it.</p>
<p>Consistency is alright. The top and bottom halves give the same bite, one just has the appearance of transparency.
They&rsquo;re really the same feeling, though. Not too tough, slightly mushy, but the grease really just distracts from the bite.</p>
<p>The flavors are good; granted, none of them are new and all are just ripped from the original product. Taste is king, though,
so they earn considerable points here.</p>
<p>Lastly, as hinted at prior, the manufacturing really leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>It gets egregious when an entire flavor is missing, even if it&rsquo;s just one of six.</p>

<h2> Recommendation: â˜¹ðŸ‘Žï¸Ž</h2>
<p>Just get regular Sweet Tarts and avoid the grease.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think my first official Sweet Synopsis review would be on a $13 Japanese import I found at a smoke shop.

<p>I didn&rsquo;t even see the price tag until it got rung up and in the moment, all I wanted was to <em>not</em> look broke and lame. I panicked
and not only bought the gummies, but happily took the 2 for $30 deal on geek bars with money that wasn&rsquo;t mine. I also forgot to
look at the expiration date. Granted, it&rsquo;s not like they were selling year past expired candy. Surely.</p>

<p>Ok well it&rsquo;s not a year past expired. It&rsquo;s eight months and those four can make all the difference I hope. Astute readers will have
already noticed this.</p>

<p>As part of the formalities, each gummy has 0.3 grams of sugar. There are 19 gummies in the bag, which gives us an extremely
impressive 5.7 grams of sugar in the entire package. As more of these are released, you&rsquo;ll see just how incredible that stat is.
American nutrition facts don&rsquo;t give decimal values, so that is also appreciated here. 0.3g turns into &lt;1g which is just stupid
and uninformative.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the &ldquo;Shelf Life: 10 Months&rdquo; at the bottom. I&rsquo;m praying that I&rsquo;ll never have to review another piece of candy
that&rsquo;s a year and a half old.</p>
<p>Opening the bag delivered an intensely stiff scent of melon. It&rsquo;s to be expected but damn was it strong. If you see a flavored food
in Japan that&rsquo;s colored green, there&rsquo;s a 99% chance it&rsquo;s melon flavored.</p>

<p>These are no doubt all just reused renders of the characters but it&rsquo;s still very cute. I recognize quite a few of them, like the
Mario 3D World one right from the bottom left, and the mario party one to the right of that. I&rsquo;m gonna try the odd red out on the
far left.</p>

<p>This feels like a bad omen, but it&rsquo;s one I signed up for.</p>
<p>I mentioned the green was most definitely melon from the smell. As for the other flavor: I had probably subconsciously read this
on the English part of the packaging and forgot, but I correctly guessed it was cola. I can&rsquo;t read japanese. Astute readers will
have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Anyways, I won&rsquo;t be saying this ever again to be clear, but in the spirit of the episode&hellip; itadakimasu.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about what you&rsquo;d expect &ndash; a hard swallow. The inside is actually really good, which gives me the impression that if these
weren&rsquo;t crusted and 18 months old, I&rsquo;d be having a great time. I should reiterate how impressive it is that they&rsquo;re plenty sweet
and have a fifth of the sugar the next episode&rsquo;s subject has.</p>

<p>The melon flavor was alright. It&rsquo;s standard melon flavor, but I&rsquo;m just not super partial towards it.</p>
<p>I got a mushroom too, which makes me think how many other shapes are in here. On the packaging, they only advertise a Mario and
a Yoshi. Astute readers will have already noticed this.</p>
<p>Finishing that one off I realized that I really don&rsquo;t want to eat these anymore. The only reasonable thing to do, then, is to open
up all the remaining pieces to see which gummy shapes I get.</p>

<p>I think I hear someone faintly whispering something like &ldquo;Killlll meeeeeee.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m definitely not eating him if that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s
asking.</p>

<p>Just wanted to reiterate how FUCKING OLD THESE THINGS ARE.</p>
<p>Anyways, with all of them opened, I have the complete roundup.</p>

<p>I found one more! A koopa shell, or I guess it&rsquo;d be a green shell like how the mushroom is a red mushroom. Maybe the idea is that
green mario is supposed to be luigi, because shape of gummy has a red and green variant within the games.</p>
<p>As shitty as this lighting is, it actually better represents the color of the gummies. They&rsquo;re not nearly as dark in shade as the
other pictures would suggest.</p>
<p>I dunno. Maybe these would be edible if you cut off the crust shell.</p>
<h2> Final Score: 2 bangins</h2>
<h2> â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†</h2>
<p>Like all Sweet Synopsis reviews, we start with a base of 2Â½ bangins.</p>
<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +1: Neat rare shapes.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +Â½: Cute packaging renders.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +Â½: Low amount of high quality sugar.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  +Â½: Good, standard cola flavoring.
</li>
<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">

<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -1Â½: The price.
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 1rem">
  -Â½: Melon flavoring is just not my favorite.
</li>
<h2> Recommendation: â˜¹ðŸ‘Žï¸Ž</h2>
<p>Only if you&rsquo;re in japan. If you can find them cheap and relatively fresh, they&rsquo;re well worth it.</p>

Ironically, I had another topic I planned on writing about today that was also Minecraft-related, but that will have to wait.</p><p>In their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=542rY0DQHIM">latest update video</a>, Mojang has given copper a handful of new use cases.
For the purposes of this discussion, the one standout announcement is that of <strong>copper tools and armor</strong>.</p><p>There&rsquo;s an obvious discussion to be had here. Where exactly do I start, though? Minecraft&rsquo;s traditional progression system:</p><img src=/images/gaming/progression%201.png style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0;border:none;box-shadow:none;transform:scale(1);transform-origin:top left"><p>Wood -> Stone -> Iron -> Diamond</p><p>got <em>extended</em> with the introduction of</p><img src=/images/gaming/progression%202.png style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0;border:none;box-shadow:none;transform:scale(1);transform-origin:top left"><p>Wood -> Stone -> Iron -> Diamond <strong>-> Netherite</strong></p><p>five years and one week ago, and has largely been seen as a successful endeavor. This came in spite of immediate discourse of eroding
tradition and arguing sacrilege for making an ore more powerful than diamond, because, well, <strong>it&rsquo;s diamond!</strong> You can&rsquo;t do that!</p><p>I&rsquo;m aware of how those takes aged. I&rsquo;m not explicitly rejecting copper&rsquo;s new role, I&rsquo;m more questioning it&rsquo;s potential impact, because
denouncing change for fear of cultural or traditional impact isn&rsquo;t exactly productive. At the time, I think it was right to point out the lack
of direct post-game progression to make use of netherite, because that&rsquo;s exactly what we ended up with in following updates (the warden, tricky trials, etc.).</p><p>So what happens when the new ore slots squarely <em>within</em> the existing progression?</p><img src=/images/gaming/progression%203.png style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0;border:none;box-shadow:none;transform:scale(1);transform-origin:top left"><p>Wood -> Stone <strong>-> Copper -></strong> Iron -> Diamond -> Netherite</p><p>Honestly, probably not much, but it may depend on the level of player you are. I&rsquo;d wager seasoned players get to iron well within the first hour of starting a world,
so was there really a gap to address? There may be, and time will tell, but I doubt many people were pining Mojang to close the gap between stone and iron. The issue
is more so that copper is useless, which isn&rsquo;t a strong case for effectively diluting the very solid pace of progression Minecraft&rsquo;s ore system has demonstrably proven.</p><p>In a way, it feels like they&rsquo;re backtracking. For all intents and purposes, if Mojang had strong conviction that copper&rsquo;s purpose was, at least partially, that of an ore for progression,
they wouldn&rsquo;t have waited four years to give them such a role. Rewatching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBvZ2Iqmm3M">Caves & Cliffs First Look</a>, Vanilla Minecraft Game Director
Agnes Larsson states:</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I got inspired by the pretty copper roofs in Stockholm, and they are all green because we have so many old buildings there. We actually added
that mechanic to Minecraft&mldr; I think it&rsquo;s so cool because it actually adds history to Minecraft.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that copper was always positioned as a building ore, but now Mojang feels the need to justify the sheer amount of it you find within caves by transitioning it&rsquo;s role
to one of more general purpose, à la iron or gold. A similar thing happened with Lapis quite some time ago, albeit to a far lesser extent.</p><p>Lapis didn&rsquo;t get armor or tools, but it did see the entire enchantment system reworked alongside it. That panned out well, so this very well may too.
I&rsquo;m just struggling to find the merit in this specific use case for copper. It feels like Mojang is casually toying with one of Minecraft&rsquo;s most tried strengths in an attempt to justify a past
miscalculation.</p></content><nav style=margin-bottom:4rem></nav><section class=comments><h3>Leave a comment</h3><form method=POST action=https://leespeak-api.vercel.app/api/submit><input type=hidden name=slug value=copper_tools>
